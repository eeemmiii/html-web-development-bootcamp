<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I bought this bootcamp from Udemy to brush up on my web developer skills. I have some experience making web pages and have completed a project a few years ago. However, those skills, well they don't vanish, of course, but they are in need of some brushing up. The basics I remembered quite well. I was happy to make such an observation!</p>

<p>So far the course has gone through the basic HTML code and as I said I remembered most of it quite well. Nevertheless, there was something new, there always is. I cannot be a hundred percent sure the knowledge was such that it hasn't been mentioned before, but as I am human I can only take in so much information. Now was the time for that information to sink in.</p>
