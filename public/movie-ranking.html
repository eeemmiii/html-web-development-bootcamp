<h1>The Best Movies according to Emmi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dances with Wolves</h3>
<p>I've seen it tens of times, the director's version that is. It is a beautiful movie with beautiful scenery and a beautiful story. It is a historical movie that tells one story of an Indian i.e. First Nation  tribe. Unfortunately, these indigineous tribes suffered because of an invasion of settlers from Europe.</p>
<h3>Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>This was a movie that affected me, when I was a teenager. However, it was also an emergence of a powerful woman in a leading role. The performance of Jodie Foster is maybe the real reason for me liking this movie. As an adult I would never even have watched this movie, because I don't like to watch horror movies. As an adult I have found the world to be a place, where I don't need to watch horror.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>I don't watch movies anymore. This is why I had to google "the movies of all time". I looked at the list, and number one on the list was Rita Hayworth. Yes, I have seen that movie and I consider it to be a good movie. However, I didn't remember much of it. That is why I scrolled down the list and found this movie. the story of Gump is enchanting and makes an excellent historical movie, a movie of American history. This movie tells an amazing story and in my opinion has a happy ending. I like happy endings.</p>
